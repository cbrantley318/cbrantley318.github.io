        <h1>
            Arrival in Taiwan (5/30/2024 - 6/1/2024)
        </h1>
        <p>
            <h3>Getting there</h3>
            &emsp;After a 3 hour drive where we saw a giant "Trump: Convicted Felon" billboard (unfortunately I was unable to get a picture of that),
            my parents dropped me off at JFK airport. I wasn't able to get a boarding pass on the mobile app, so I had to wait for an hour to finally get my ticket from China Airlines.
            Half of Terminal 4 was under construction so I spent most of the time I had trying to figure out which gate my flight would actually be leaving on.
            <br>
            &emsp;The flight itself went great, I slept for most of the 16 hours I was in the air, and we landed in Taoyuan at 5:40 in the morning.
            The customs and immigration process went pretty smoothly, and after I got my bags I exchanged $800 that I brought into $NTD.
            <br>&emsp;Then, I had to figure out how to get to the University from the airport. The easiest option probably would've been a taxi, but I decided to take the bullet train since I initially planned on 
            meeting another student at the airport and taking the train with them. I needed to take the metro to get to the train station, so I bought 
            an EasyCard for the metro since I didn't really know how to buy a single ticket. At the bullet train station, I bought
            a ticket for a reserved seat, and I was able to store my luggage in the seat next to me. The bullet train only took 11 minutes to reach Hsinchu, where I took a taxi to the dorm.
            <br>&emsp;Finding the dorm proved very challenging, as the address given was the address of the university, not the address of the dorm building.
            Eventually I found it and was able to get my key, and then I walked over to the actual dorm and found my room. My roommate Jackie was already there, he's a Taiwanese student
            studying education. 

            <br>
            <h3>Food</h3>
            &emsp;Once I got situated, my roomate and I went to Sukiya, a Japanese place right off campus. The food there was great, although I'm still not entirely sure what I ordered.
            It was a massive beef and rice bowl, and it also came with a bowl of mixed greens and a bowl of soup broth. For about $5 USD, it was a ton of food and left me full for the entire day.
            <br>&emsp;After that, I met up with Josh and Jadelyn, two of the other Duke students in the program. They arrived a day earlier but stayed in a hotel in Taipei since
            the dorms weren't ready for move-in yet. Josh had lost his wallet in sometime between their taxi ride to the school and when they walked to the dorm key building, so I spent
            about an hour with them looking for his wallet. Unfortunately we couldn't find it yet, but he notified the local police departments so they'll keep an eye out for.
            Then we got dinner at the 小吃部 (Xiao chi bu), a cafeteria with a bunch of different restaurants. The only ones that are open on weekends were McDonalds and 7/11, so I had a McChicken from Mcdonalds.
            Not exactly what I had planned on eating my first night in Taiwan but it was pretty good. 
            <br>&emsp;The next day, we met at 8 am to walk around campus and find where our classes would be. They're all in General Building II, which is where the Chinese Language Center is.
            A lot of the signs were also in English so it was pretty easy to find. Then, we walked around some more and found another eating area with a Family Mart (similar to 7/11) and some other restaurants.
            I ordered like a pork breakfast sandwich which was pretty good.

        <h1>
            First weekend (6/1/2024 - 6/3-2024)
        </h1>
        <p>
            We went out to explore Hsinchu some more by taking the bus into the city and ended up going to two temples. We also got some boba and walked around some more.
            After we came back we went to 7/11 and a few places around campus.
        </p>

        <h1>
            First Week of Classes
        </h1>
        <p>
            &emsp;Classes were definitely a bit rough in the beginning. In high school and at Duke, we learned using Simplified Characters, which are commonly used in mainland China
            and not used at all in Taiwan. Here, classes are taught using Traditional Characters, which meant I had to relearn most of the vocabulary that I already knew.
            <br>&emsp;In addition to classes, a lot of the American students on the Huayu scholarship had to figure out a ton of stuff in regards to that. In order to do pretty much
            anything in Taiwan (including receiving the scholarship to be here), you need to have a Taiwanese bank account. And in order to get a bank account, you need a Taiwanese cell phone number, which 
            many of us didn't have. Over the span of about 4 days, we took a bus after class to go into Hsinchu to the National Immigration Agency center, where we all got immigrant ID numbers 
            (also necessary for a bank account). Once we got back to campus, we walked to a stamp shop to make wooden stamps with our Chinese names on them, which was used as a sort
            of signature for the bank account forms. 
            Then, we went to the post office to make bank accounts, which is where we learned that we needed phone numbers to open the account. However, many people either didn't need sim cards
            (like me), or they couldn't get one because their phone was still locked to another carrier. Eventually, me and four others bought sim cards from a store not too far from campus,
            only to find out minutes later that we could use the program director's phone number on the application instead. I decided to keep the sim card, and I'll find out tomorrow if I can make a bank account.

            Week Two
        </h1>
        <p>
            <h3>
                Taipei (6/9-6/10)
            </h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;This should really be a part of week 1, but over the weekend we went on a trip to Taipei for the Dragonboat Festival (called 端午節 - Duan Wu Jie).
                While the holiday is officially on Monday, there were events going on over the entire weekend for it, and we got off class on Monday so we had a three day weekend.
                After taking a bus on Saturday from Hsinchu to Taipei, we rode the Taipei metro to the Dajia riverside park to watch the boat races.
                We couldn't stay for too long, though, since we had to check into our AirBnb in Taipei by 5:00. After we checked in, we walked around Taipei some more,
                and in the evening we went to Raohe night market, one of the many night markets in Taipei with a bunch of different stalls selling lots of snacks and other food
                (called 小吃 - xiaochi, which literally means "small food")

                Class (and food poisoning)
            </h3>
            <p>
                Class this week went better than the first week, 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Nan-Liao Beach (Friday, 6/14/24)
            </h3>
            <p>
                Friday afternoon, a few of us decided to go out to the northern side of Hsinchu to the coastline, where they have a market similar to a nightmarket, a park, and a harbor nearby.
                We decided to take the bus, which proved to be a mistake as we went at the same time that many students from the nearby high school got let out of class, so the bus wound up being 
                almost as crowded as the Duke busses and stopping at nearly every stop on the way, stretching what could have been a 20 minute car ride into an hour and a half-long journey. Eventually, we reached our 
                destination, 
                <br>&emsp;Getting back proved almost as much of a hassle as getting there was. No Ubers operated in that area at that time, so instead
                we took the bus back. However, the bus dropped us off in the CBD of Hsinchu, so we had to find another bus that went back to campus.
                Usually, this meant going to the central hub station where all of the busses depart from, but we were dropped off on the opposite side of the city, so 
                instead we tried to find a bus stop nearby. While this sounds like a relatively simple task, both Google and Apple Maps are outdated when it comes to the 
                locations of bus stops in the city and which busses serve those areas, so we spent a good 20 minutes walking in circles between various stops that
                we thought were the correct location. In that time, we also ran into two Mormon missionaries who mostly seemed excited to find other foreigners that they could
                speak English with. They also helped us figure out where the bus stop was and gave a few good recommendations for where to go in the city on a free day.
