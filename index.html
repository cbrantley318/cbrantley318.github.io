        <h1>
            Arrival in Taiwan (5/30/2024 - 6/1/2024)
        </h1>
        <p>
            <h3>Getting there</h3>
            &emsp;After a 3 hour drive where we saw a giant "Trump: Convicted Felon" billboard (unfortunately I was unable to get a picture of that),
            my parents dropped me off at JFK airport. I wasn't able to get a boarding pass on the mobile app, so I had to wait for an hour to finally get my ticket from China Airlines.
            Half of Terminal 4 was under construction so I spent most of the time I had trying to figure out which gate my flight would actually be leaving on.
            <br>
            &emsp;The flight itself went great, I slept for most of the 16 hours I was in the air, and we landed in Taoyuan at 5:40 in the morning.
            The customs and immigration process went pretty smoothly, and after I got my bags I exchanged $800 that I brought into $NTD.
            <br>&emsp;Then, I had to figure out how to get to the University from the airport. The easiest option probably would've been a taxi, but I decided to take the bullet train since I initially planned on 
            meeting another student at the airport and taking the train with them. I needed to take the metro to get to the train station, so I bought 
            an EasyCard for the metro since I didn't really know how to buy a single ticket. At the bullet train station, I bought
            a ticket for a reserved seat, and I was able to store my luggage in the seat next to me. The bullet train only took 11 minutes to reach Hsinchu, where I took a taxi to the dorm.
            <br>&emsp;Finding the dorm proved very challenging, as the address given was the address of the university, not the address of the dorm building.
            Eventually I found it and was able to get my key, and then I walked over to the actual dorm and found my room. My roommate Jackie was already there, he's a Taiwanese student
            studying education. 

            <br>
            <h3>Food</h3>
            &emsp;Once I got situated, my roomate and I went to Sukiya, a Japanese place right off campus. The food there was great, although I'm still not entirely sure what I ordered.
            It was a massive beef and rice bowl, and it also came with a bowl of mixed greens and a bowl of soup broth. For about $5 USD, it was a ton of food and left me full for the entire day.
            <br>&emsp;After that, I met up with Josh and Jadelyn, two of the other Duke students in the program. They arrived a day earlier but stayed in a hotel in Taipei since
            the dorms weren't ready for move-in yet. Josh had lost his wallet in sometime between their taxi ride to the school and when they walked to the dorm key building, so I spent
            about an hour with them looking for his wallet. Unfortunately we couldn't find it yet, but he notified the local police departments so they'll keep an eye out for.
            Then we got dinner at the 小吃部 (Xiao chi bu), a cafeteria with a bunch of different restaurants. The only ones that are open on weekends were McDonalds and 7/11, so I had a McChicken from Mcdonalds.
            Not exactly what I had planned on eating my first night in Taiwan but it was pretty good. 
            <br>&emsp;The next day, we met at 8 am to walk around campus and find where our classes would be. They're all in General Building II, which is where the Chinese Language Center is.
            A lot of the signs were also in English so it was pretty easy to find. Then, we walked around some more and found another eating area with a Family Mart (similar to 7/11) and some other restaurants.
            I ordered like a pork breakfast sandwich which was pretty good.

            First weekend (6/1/2024 - 6/3-2024)
        </h1>
        <p>
            We went out to explore Hsinchu some more by taking the bus into the city and ended up going to two temples. We also got some boba and walked around some more.
            After we came back we went to 7/11 and a few places around campus.
        </p>

        <h1>
            First Week of Classes
        </h1>
        <p>
            &emsp;Classes were definitely a bit rough in the beginning. In high school and at Duke, we learned using Simplified Characters, which are commonly used in mainland China
            and not used at all in Taiwan. Here, classes are taught using Traditional Characters, which meant I had to relearn most of the vocabulary that I already knew.
            <br>&emsp;In addition to classes, a lot of the American students on the Huayu scholarship had to figure out a ton of stuff in regards to that. In order to do pretty much
            anything in Taiwan (including receiving the scholarship to be here), you need to have a Taiwanese bank account. And in order to get a bank account, you need a Taiwanese cell phone number, which 
            many of us didn't have. Over the span of about 4 days, we took a bus after class to go into Hsinchu to the National Immigration Agency center, where we all got immigrant ID numbers 
            (also necessary for a bank account). Once we got back to campus, we walked to a stamp shop to make wooden stamps with our Chinese names on them, which was used as a sort
            of signature for the bank account forms. 
            Then, we went to the post office to make bank accounts, which is where we learned that we needed phone numbers to open the account. However, many people either didn't need sim cards
            (like me), or they couldn't get one because their phone was still locked to another carrier. Eventually, me and four others bought sim cards from a store not too far from campus,
            only to find out minutes later that we could use the program director's phone number on the application instead. I decided to keep the sim card, and I'll find out tomorrow if I can make a bank account.
            <br>&emsp;For the Dragonboat festival, the Chinese Language Center put on an event where we could make sachets that looked like a zongzi (picutred below).

            <h3>
                Taipei (6/9-6/10)
            </h3>
            <p>
                &emsp;This should really be a part of week 1, but over the weekend we went on a trip to Taipei for the Dragonboat Festival (called 端午節 - Duan Wu Jie).
                While the holiday is officially on Monday, there were events going on over the entire weekend for it, and we got off class on Monday so we had a three day weekend.
                After taking a bus on Saturday from Hsinchu to Taipei, we rode the Taipei metro to the Dajia riverside park to watch the boat races.
                We couldn't stay for too long, though, since we had to check into our AirBnb in Taipei by 5:00. After we checked in, we walked around Taipei some more,
                and in the evening we went to Raohe night market, one of the many night markets in Taipei with a bunch of different stalls selling lots of snacks and other food
                (called 小吃 - xiaochi, which literally means "small food")

                Class (and food poisoning)
            </h3>
            <p>
                Class this week went better than the first week, now that I got a bit more accustomed to reading traditional characters as opposed to simplified.
                <br>&emsp;Thursday evening, we went with Sofia, an older Duke student who has been in Taiwan since January, to a restaurant right off campus that served noodles 
                with duck blood and pig intestines.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Nan-Liao Beach (Friday, 6/14/24)
            </h3>
            <p>
                Friday afternoon, a few of us decided to go out to the northern side of Hsinchu to the coastline, where they have a market similar to a nightmarket, a park, and a harbor nearby.
                We decided to take the bus, which proved to be a mistake as we went at the same time that many students from the nearby high school got let out of class, so the bus wound up being 
                almost as crowded as the Duke busses and stopping at nearly every stop on the way, stretching what could have been a 20 minute car ride into an hour and a half-long journey. Eventually, we reached our 
                destination and got to see the black-sand beach there, although most of the stalls in the market were closed, so that was a bit of a let down.
                <br>&emsp;Getting back proved almost as much of a hassle as getting there was. No Ubers operated in that area at that time, so instead
                we took the bus back. However, the bus dropped us off in the CBD of Hsinchu, so we had to find another bus that went back to campus.
                Usually, this meant going to the central hub station where all of the busses depart from, but we were dropped off on the opposite side of the city, so 
                instead we tried to find a bus stop nearby. While this sounds like a relatively simple task, both Google and Apple Maps are outdated when it comes to the 
                locations of bus stops in the city and which busses serve those areas, so we spent a good 20 minutes walking in circles between various stops that
                we thought were the correct location. In that time, we also ran into two Mormon missionaries who mostly seemed excited to find other foreigners that they could
                speak English with. They also helped us figure out where the bus stop was and gave a few good recommendations for where to go in the city on a free day.

                Classes have been getting better for the most part. I'm able to follow along with almost everything the teacher says in class,
                and I'm able to actually read the questions on the quizzes now, so that's a plus. On Tuesday all of the Duke students got lunch with
                Li Laoshi, the head of the Chinese department at Duke. She comes to Taiwan every year to check in on how the program is going
                and if there are any issues. The restaurant we went to was really good, the food was served fairly similar to family style where the entire 
                table ordered dishes to share. We got pretty much some of everything, from noodles with squid, scallops, and other seafood to crispy duck.

                In addition to a steak, every dish came with noodles and a fried egg, and the restaurant had unlimited soup, bread, and ice cream all 
                for a little under $6 USD.

                Taipei Day Trip (6/23)
            </h3>
            <p>
                On Sunday, we arranged a day trip to Taipei to go hiking in Yangminshan national park and then spend the rest of the day
                in Taipei. We left at around 9 in the morning to take the bus over to Taipei, where we then took a taxi to Yangmingshan national park, located just north of Taipei.
                Once we arrived, we stopped to look at the volcanic fumaroles at the base of the mountain. Then we started the ascent up the Main Peak, which in good conditions 
                could take as little as an hour. Even though today was fairly cloudy, it was still quite hot and the hike itself was pretty strenuous.
                In addition, all of the volcanic fumaroles had sulfur deposits, which made certain areas of the mountain smell like rotten eggs.
                Eventually, we got to the top of the main peak, where there were more bugs than I could count. The bugs weren't that bad on the way up, but 
                at the very top it was hard to take a step without walking into a moth or a bunch of gnats. The East Peak was slightly better, although we didn't 
                stay for too long since it was getting late in the afternoon and we wanted to get down before it started raining. On the way down, we stopped 
                at a little gazebo and took a break before arriving at the visitor center, where we decided if we wanted to head back to Taipei or continue hiking 
                on a flatter trail. Ultimately, we went back to Taipei, in part because the bus that would take us to the other trail didn't stop when it drove by, and 
                the next one wouldn't arrive for another 20 minutes (it turns out that bus in particular is supposed to be flagged down like a cab, something we found out 
                only after it drove off). Once we got to Taipei, we got dinner at a ramen noodle place and then took the bus back to Hsinchu at around 6:30, leaving me with 
                enough time to

                On Thursday and Friday we had a substitute teacher in our class since our usual teacher was away, and on Friday we took our sixth overall vocab quiz.
                On Friday night a few of the other Americans and I got together to watch the presidential debate (about 12 hours later, since the debate

               Once we got there, we walked to the National Museum of Natural Sciences, which had a lot of information about how Taiwanese culture evolved and a lot of 
               general evolutionary exhibits. After that, we got lunch at a restaurant Yaokai found that was really good, and then we went to the city center to meet up with Josh, who was 
               coming late. After we found him, we bought a box of pineapple cakes from a bakery and went to the world's first boba shop, Chun Shui Taichung.

                This weekend, I went on another day trip to Taichung, this time with Audrey, Nina, and Kendra. We first stopped a little short 
                of Taichung to visit the Zhongshe flower garden in Houli, which was about an hour North of Taichung. We decided to take the train 
                since it stopped close to the garden, whereas the bus we took before only goes into the city center. After that, we went to the 
                Rainbow Village, which was also a little bit outside of the city but still closer than the flower garden was. It wasn't very big, but 
                it was neat seeing the paintings/drawings up on display. After taking a bus from there into the city center, we got 
                ice cream from Miyahara, which a lot of people say looks like Hogwarts. It was really good, and afterwards we went to a night market in 
                Taichung where I tried some seared scallops, grape tanghulu, and a duck roll. Then we took the bus back to Hsinchu, getting back at around 10 at night.

                The next day, I went to Taipei for the afternoon. I first went to see the Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall, and I arrived at about 12:50 which was 
                just in time for the changing of the guard at 1. After visiting the memorial, I walked over to the Taipei Botanical Gardens, where 
                unfortunately it started thunderstorming about twenty minutes after I got there. I tried to wait it out a little bit, but 
                eventually gave up and took the metro over to Ximending, by which time it had stopped raining. Ximending had a lot of tourist shops, but I was only 
                in the area because it was on the way to a board game store in Taipei, where I wanted to find a nice xiangqi (Chinese Chess) set.
                Unfortunately I didn't find it there, but they did have a lot of Chinese and Taiwanese versions of games, which was to be expected. 
                After I left, I went into a nearby bookstore just to look around, and they ended up having a set available. Afterwards, I went back to 
                Hsinchu since I still had an exam to study for the next day.
